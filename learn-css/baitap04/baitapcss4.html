        <h1>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</h1>
        <p>Mon Mar 10,2014 by Your Name </p>
        <p>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that dicretory not starting with will be copied as is to the site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there.With Jekyll,something that looked like <root>/ images/logo.png should become <root>/ static/ imgaes/logo.png Additionenally,you'll want any files that should reside at the root(such as CNAME) to be moved to static </p>
